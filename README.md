# JSUMS120

This is my "extension" of the SymPy port for Julia that I will use in my MS 120 Applied Calculus class at Jacksonville State University. 
It is my first use of Julia and is designed to be used in a Jupyter Notebook. 
As I learn more about Julia I might to rewrite it to be used in other environments.
